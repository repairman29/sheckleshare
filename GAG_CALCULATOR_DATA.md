## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Value Calculation Formula
```
Final Value = Base Value √ó Weight Multiplier √ó Growth Multiplier √ó Environmental Multiplier
```

Where:
- **Weight Multiplier** = (Current Weight / Base Weight)¬≤
- **Growth Multiplier** = Product of all growth mutation multipliers
- **Environmental Multiplier** = 1 + Sum of environmental mutation bonuses - Number of environmental mutations

### Mutation Conflicts
- Mutations with conflicts cannot be applied simultaneously
- Higher-tier mutations often replace or remove lower-tier ones
- Exclusive mutations can only be applied to specific crops

### Pet Abilities
- Each pet has unique abilities with specific cooldowns
- Abilities can affect crops, other pets, or the player
- Some pets have passive abilities that work continuously
